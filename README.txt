The application is built using React Native.
To run the application you need to install the node modules,
and then run npx expo start. On your phone you need to download the application Expo GO.
After that you can just scan the QR code and the app should open.
You need to be connected to the same network as the machine running the application.

PS. If the app doesn't work, try running npx expo start --tunnel.
